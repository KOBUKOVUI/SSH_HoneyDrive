# SSH_HoneyDrive :honeybee:
How to use Kippo SSH honeypot and analyze a brute-fore attack.
## Description
This project help you have an overview how a honeypot works. We will use HoneyDrive 
which is a honeypot Linux Distro. It's a vitual appliance (OVA) with Xubuntu Desktop
installed. It has 10 pre-installed honeypot software packges. But in this project 
we will focus on using Kippo SSH honeypot to lure hackers and capture their signatures.

In this project, we will use Kali Linux as an Attacker :crossed_swords: and HoneyDrive 
as a victim :shield:. In Kali Linux **_Nmap_** and **_Medusa_**(a brute-force tool) will 
be used.
